		<h2>"What's with the capitalization?"</h2>
		<p>I choose not to capitalize section headers when they aren't full sentences or proper nouns because i believe capitalization is a poor way of differentiating a piece of text as a title. This is because capitalization already has a variety of other uses, and so using it in titles can cause ambiguity. Why capitalize a title when formatting is a better way to show that it's a title?</p>
		<p>I also don't think there's any reason to capitalize the word "i"; it's just like any other personal pronoun, yet it's the only one that's conventionally capitalized. This is a nonsensical convention that i feel the need to resist. Of course, this practice of mine excludes cases when "i" is capitalized for other reasons – for example, when it's the first word of a sentence.</p>

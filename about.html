		<h2>"What's with the capitalization?"</h2>
		<p>I don't capitalize headers when they aren't full sentences or proper nouns because i believe "title case" is a janky, ambiguous way of differentiating a piece of text as a title. I also don't think there's any reason to capitalize "i" when it's not the first word in a sentence because it should be treated like any other pronoun.</p>

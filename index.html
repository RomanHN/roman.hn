		<h3>Extended Essay</h3>
		<p>For the IB Diploma program, i wrote my Extended Essay about creating a system of equations to graph tangent lines to two circles. I also did a virtual presentation about the essay during my school's Extended Essay Showcase.</p>

		<h3>Desmos</h3>
		<p>For each of my Desmos projects, i've included the output from the console command <code>Calc.getState()</code>, just in case Desmos stops hosting the graph for some reason. You can open the Desmos link, or alternatively, you can load the project using <code>Calc.setState()</code> in the browser console. Simply paste the <code>Calc.getState()</code> text file between the parentheses and press enter. More information at the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.6/docs/index.html">Desmos API documentation</a>.</p>

		<h3>charts</h3>

			<li><a href="/creations/popular_interests.svg">popular interests of CHS seniors</a> – My school sent out a survey to seniors, and one of the questions asked responders to list some of their interests. The anonymized responses were made public, so out of curiosity, i cleaned up the data and made a chart which shows what's most popular with the class of 2021.</li>

		<h3>printable</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="/creations/word_list.pdf">printable EFF second short word list</a> – The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) created <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases">three lists of words</a> to be used to generate passphrases by rolling dice. This is a printable version of their second short word list, the one with the unique three-character prefixes. The words are separated into six pages with six columns each, easing the process of passphrase generation.</li>

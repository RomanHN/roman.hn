    <p>Hey there! I'm Roman. I like math, computer science, and (very occasionally) making music. This website exists to store and showcase links to my creations and things i find interesting, as well as a way for me to learn HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h3>Desmos</h3>
	<p>For each of my Desmos projects, i've included the output from the console command Calc.getState(), just in case Desmos stops hosting the graph for some reason. You can open the Desmos link, or alternatively, you can load the project using Calc.setState() in the console. Simply paste the Calc.getState() text file between the parentheses and press enter. More information at the <a href="https://www.desmos.com/api/v1.6/docs/index.html">Desmos API documentation</a>.</p>

The anonymized responses were made public, so out of curiosity, i cleaned up the data and made a chart which shows what's most popular with the class of 2021.</li>

    <h3>music</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://soundcloud.com/roman-hauksson-neill/up-next">Up Next</a> - This song was made as a "self-learning project" for Theory of Knowledge. I had to choose something to learn on my own and then explain and demonstrate the results in a presentation - i chose to learn how to produce a song. It's not a good song, but i had fun making it.</li>

    <h2>"Why don't you capitalize the pronoun 'i'?"</h2>
    <p>"I" is just like any other personal pronoun, yet it's the only one that's conventionally capitalized. Capitalizing it is a nonsensical convention that i feel the need to resist. Of course, this excludes cases when "i" is capitalized for other reasons - for example, when it's the first word of a sentence.</p>

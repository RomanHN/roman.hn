                <p>I led four participants through a <a href="https://github.com/ACM-Research/targeted-password-guesses">research project</a> about automatically predicting users' passwords based on information like their username and profile bio. In short, we fine-tuned a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3">GPT-3</a> model on credentials from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattpad#June_2020_data_breach">Wattpad security breach</a>. This was the winning project out of six during the presentation/poster contest.</p>

      <h2>lyrics - "White-Collar Criminals"</h2>
    </header>
    <h3>intro - Roman Hauksson-Neill</h3>
    
    <p>What's this, another rap song about drugs, money, and crime?<br>
    But, us thugs didn't come out of poverty<br>
    We created it!</p>
    
    <h3>verse 1 - Basil Stein</h3>
    
    <p>I confess, I'd pay my workers less<br>
    If I wouldn't lose my profit when the union protests<br>
    They really bite me, (What?) I don't understand<br>
    I'm the one that feeds them, I am the hand</p>
    
    <p>I'm gonna axe the unions like Trotsky (Okay)<br>
    My daughter just called me the bourgeoisie (Damn)<br>
    What she talkin' 'bout, my lambos don't shine<br>
    Employees like grapes, all they do is whine</p>
    
    <h3>chorus - Basil Stein, <em>Roman Hauksson-Neill</em></h3>
    
    <p>I'm at the top of the pyramid, the MLM<br>
    <em>I'm a white-collar criminal</em><br>
    It's all overpriced, want some epinephrine?<br>
    <em>A white-collar criminal</em><br>
    Yeah, gimme a pen, I gotta write a fake check<br>
    <em>Your friendly neighborhood white-collar criminal</em><br>
    I'm swimmin' in the money and it's up to my neck<br>
    <em>We're those white-collar criminals</em></p>
    
    <h3>verse 2 - Roman Hauksson-Neill</h3>
    
    <p>Yesterday, after a good putt<br>
    My homie King Tut, yeah he called me up<br>
    Yeah we talked about building pyramids<br>
    Alright, listen, the theorem is</p>
    
    <p>The more you take, the more you make<br>
    Don't pay taxes, avoid the headache<br>
    You're a nonprofit, and it's a business expense<br>
    Don't be afraid to save a couple cents</p>
    
    <p>But don't lemme convince you I got it all figured out<br>
    Matter a' fact, I gotta lotta inner doubt<br>
    My therapist helps me with my depression<br>
    Reassures me I didn't cause the recession</p>
    
    <p>The money I make, I get it unfairly<br>
    I bought some fake teeth so I could rob the tooth fairy!</p>
    
    <p>Sorry, this recent lawsuit's got me uptight<br>
    I'm tryna wish my plaintiffs a permanent good night</p>
    
    <h3>verse 3 - Basil Stein</h3>
    
    <p>We'll talk it out, think that we can reach a settlement<br>
    If they don't blow the whistle on the embezzlement (Okay)<br>
    Yeah I don't really care if my workers go broke (Ooh)<br>
    Only thing that matters is that I can buy more coke</p>
    
    <p>I've got a hole in my nose, it isn't a piercin' (Damn)<br>
    I own a nonprofit but I ain't volunteerin'<br>
    I'm such a good dealer, I've got the taps on fluoride<br>
    All my family's money, yeah we got it from apartheid</p>
    
    <h3>chorus - Basil Stein, <em>Roman Hauksson-Neill</em></h3>
    
    <p>I'm at the top of the pyramid, the MLM<br>
    <em>I'm a white-collar criminal</em><br>
    It's all overpriced, want some epinephrine?<br>
    <em>A white-collar criminal</em><br>
    Yeah, gimme a pen, I gotta write a fake check<br>
    <em>Your friendly neighborhood white-collar criminal</em><br>
    I'm swimmin' in the money and it's up to my neck<br>
    <em>We're those white-collar criminals</em><br>
    That your lawyer warned you about</p>
